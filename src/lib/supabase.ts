// @deprecated - This file is deprecated. Use api.ts instead.
// Kept for backward compatibility during migration.
// All Supabase functionality has been replaced with custom API.

// Export a dummy object to prevent import errors
// Pages still importing this should be migrated to use api.ts
export const supabase = null as any;

// TODO: Remove this file once all components are migrated to api.ts
